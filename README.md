## General Info

This application was made for the recruitment process at Remitly.
It exposes a REST API that manages SWIFT codes and allows users to:
- retrieve bank information by SWIFT code or country code
- add new SWIFT Code
- delete records

REST API was written in Java 21 with SpringBoot 3.4.4 framework.<br>
All data is stored in PostgreSQL database.<br>
Application can be deployed on any device thanks to docker containerization.


## Setup

Clone the repository and select proper directory

```
docker login    
docker-compose up --build
```

After a while, app is launched and ready!<br>
It's listening on http://localhost:8080/
